# state.md - i18n Scaling cross-phase cheat sheet

The single source of truth a fresh session reads before doing anything. Record decisions once here; reference forever. Update at the end of every phase.

---

## Current status
- **Active phase:** Phase 4 DONE (2026-06-16); next up Phase 4 QA (`docs/i18n-scaling/phase-04-qa.md`). Phase 4 deduped the three dialect pairs to divergence-only overlays (es_ES=72 keys over es, fr_CA=37 over fr_FR, en_CA=3 over en) behind a data-driven `DIALECT_BASE` merge in `scripts/i18n_build.mjs`, removed the `{} as WorldEntityTranslations` casts (deleted the dead non-English data in `world_entity_i18n.ts`, now English-only) and the `{} as TalentLocaleText` casts (explicit aliases in `talent_i18n.ts`). Resolved table byte-identical (SHA `d9db528..`). Phase 3 + Phase 3 QA DONE (PASS, 2026-06-16): added a permanent subset guard `tests/i18n_overlay_key_membership.test.ts` (commit `2c2066f`) and corrected the one-shot migration's idempotency comments (commit `c5f6738`). Phase 2 DONE (commits `3f1ed8d`, `a92ff37`, `ffb40e5`); Phase 2 QA still NOT STARTED. Phase 1 DONE + QA PASS.
- **Branch:** `refactor/i18n-phase-naming` (Phase 0 - the `phaseN`->content-name rename - is DONE and lives here). Later phases may branch `feature/i18n-<slug>` off this; confirm with the user before branching (shared worktree).
- **RFC:** `docs/design/i18n-translation-scaling.md` - the authoritative design. This packet implements it with the four decisions below applied.

## Locked design decisions (maintainer sign-off, 2026-06-16)
1. **Two-tier CI gate.** CI splits by git ref into a cheap PR gate and a full release gate. An English-only PR is legal once Phase 6 lands.
2. **Dense generated artifact keeps `tsc` safety.** A no-dep `.mjs` build script overlays sparse locales onto `en`, fills gaps from English, and emits `src/ui/i18n.resolved.generated.ts` typed `: typeof en`. Client and admin import the generated artifact. Reproducibility-checked (`git diff --exit-code`) like the media manifest.
3. **Flat dotted-key overlays for the 13 non-English locales.** `en` stays a **nested** object (authoritative base; drives `TranslationKey = Leaves<typeof en>` that ~3,532 call sites use). Each non-English locale is a flat `Partial<Record<TranslationKey, string>>` containing only translated keys. `en_CA` is a thin alias of `en`; `es_ES`/`fr_CA` are dialect overlays over `es`/`fr_FR`.
4. **`t()` on miss:** throw on an *untracked* key in dev/test; render English for a registry-`pending` key on **non-release builds only**; release builds require an empty `pending` set. This deliberately relaxes "the rendered text always comes from `t()`" for the dev/pre-release window only - a non-release build carrying `pending` keys must never be deployed.
5. **Declared-base dialect inheritance (Phase 4).** A dialect locale declares a base locale via the data-driven `DIALECT_BASE` map in `scripts/i18n_build.mjs` (`es_ES`->`es`, `fr_CA`->`fr_FR`, `en_CA`->`en`). The build resolves a dialect as nested `en` -> base-locale overlay -> dialect overlay, so the dialect overlay carries ONLY the keys whose value diverges from the base; an omitted key falls through to the base, then to English. The dialect graph lives in that one map, not in scattered per-locale branching. This is the single dialect-inheritance mechanism for the resolved table (the `{} as` casts that previously faked it in `world_entity_i18n.ts`/`talent_i18n.ts` are gone).

### Operational decisions (RFC §9.5-9.7)
- **LLM fill scope (locked):** worklist generation is automated; **prose is blocked-by-default** - quest narratives, class/ability names, and CJK talent names are `blocked: human-required` and never auto-filled. A bot may fill mechanical UI chrome only. The human owns the blocked-surface list.
- **OPEN - release fill ownership / API key (RFC §9.6):** who runs the release-time fill pass and owns the key? Bus factor must be acceptable; the worklist must be plain enough for a second maintainer. Not a code blocker; resolve before the first real release fill.
- **Non-client consumer audit (RFC §9.7):** Phase 6 + Phase 8 QA must confirm nothing outside the client seam (server-rendered HTML, `document.title`, `index.html` hreflang tags, the admin DICT, any `data-i18n-content` meta) can surface a `pending`-English string to a real user, and that the `en_XA` pseudo-locale (Phase 9) is excluded from `supportedLanguages` and hreflang.

## Non-negotiable invariants (carry into every phase)
- **`src/sim/` and `server/` stay language-agnostic** - no `t()`, no DOM. They emit English; the client matchers (`src/ui/sim_i18n.ts`, `src/ui/server_i18n.ts`, plus the `hud.ts`-local maps) re-localize at the boundary. Translation resolves only at the client boundary.
- **Determinism is untouched.** This is a UI/build/CI refactor; do not introduce `Math.random`/`Date.now`/`performance.now` anywhere in `src/sim/`. (The scanner/build scripts run at build time, not in the sim, so hashing there is fine.)
- **No new runtime dependency, no i18n framework.** Plain TypeScript data + `.mjs` build scripts, consistent with `scripts/build_media_manifest.mjs`.
- **Generated files are never hand-edited.** `i18n.resolved.generated.ts` and `i18n.status.json` carry the do-not-edit banner and are reproducibility-checked.
- **No em dashes or emojis** in player-facing copy or in these docs' shipped strings.
- **Shared worktree:** stage explicit paths, never `git add -A`. A concurrent session may share this checkout.

## The byte-equivalence safety net (Phases 1-5)
Every behavior-preserving phase is gated by **byte-equivalence of the resolved 14-locale table**. Phase 0 proved the method (the resolved table is deterministic and serializes reproducibly). The current baseline (captured in Phase 1) is **SHA-256 `d9db528bea1c7a1e02835c4d3edb3fabcee3687aad2186608f1f1d2ac83b3b9b`, 1,584,856 bytes**.
- NOTE on the byte count: Phase 0 measured 1,583,881 bytes; the current tree is 1,584,856 because commit `1c751c4` (`feat(auth): Cloudflare Turnstile`) plus a `main` merge added auth/registration i18n keys to `i18n.ts` AFTER Phase 0's snapshot. This is legitimate content, not a refactor drift. The authoritative gate is the committed `src/ui/i18n.resolved.sha256`, not the byte figure - quote the SHA, not the count.
- The mechanism for this packet (built in Phase 1):
- A script `scripts/i18n_resolved_hash.mjs` (zero deps; esbuild-bundles `src/ui/i18n.ts` like `export_loot_spreadsheet.mjs`, reassembles `translations` from the locale exports + `supportedLanguages`) serializes it deterministically with **recursive key sort** (so the hash is insertion-order-independent) and prints/`--check`s/`--write`s its SHA-256. `npm run i18n:hash` prints it.
- A committed baseline `src/ui/i18n.resolved.sha256` holds the expected hash.
- A test `tests/i18n_resolved_equivalence.test.ts` runs the script via subprocess and asserts equality.
- **The baseline hash changes ONLY in phases that deliberately change resolved output (Phase 6 onward, when `pending` keys begin to English-fill).** Phases 1-5 must leave it byte-identical. If a phase needs to touch the baseline, that is a red flag - stop and confirm the change is intended.

## Validation matrix by change type
- **Behavior-preserving structural phase (1-5):** `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run tests/localization_fixes.test.ts tests/localization_coverage.test.ts tests/server_i18n.test.ts tests/i18n_resolved_equivalence.test.ts` + the resolved-table byte-equivalence gate (hash unchanged).
- **Generated-artifact phase (2, 5):** also the reproducibility check - regenerate, then `git diff --exit-code` on `i18n.resolved.generated.ts` / `i18n.status.json` must be clean.
- **CI / gate phase (6):** the two-tier split itself must be tested: a deliberately English-only sample key passes the PR tier; a deliberately incomplete locale fails the release tier; the full localization suite passes at the release tier.
- **Admin phase (8):** admin builds and renders all 14 locales; `npm run build` (admin entry) clean; admin registry-in-sync.
- **Full-stack / pre-merge (every phase before declaring done):** `npm test && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build:env && npm run build:server && npm run build` (mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **Bundle-size check (where relevant):** note the gzipped size of the main bundle's locale payload before/after; the dense artifact must not balloon it (it replaces, not adds to, today's eager 14-locale table).

## Key file paths
### Existing (today)
- `src/ui/i18n.ts` (~13.2k lines) - types, `en`, 13 full `: typeof en` locales, assembler (`shellStrings`/`hudStrings`/`abilityStrings`/`questStrings`/`itemStrings`/`classAbilityNames`/`itemNames`/`worldNames`/`merge*`), `t()`, `tOptional`, `hasTranslation`, `translationValue`, `formatNumber`/`formatMoney`/`formatDateTime`/`moneyParts`, `getLanguage`/`setLanguage`/`isSupportedLanguage`, `supportedLanguages`, `TranslationKey`/`Leaves`.
- `src/ui/world_entity_i18n.ts` (~260 KB) - class/ability/item/mob/NPC/quest/zone/dungeon/POI names + narratives. NOTE: `es_ES`/`fr_CA` are already aliased to `es`/`fr_FR` at module load via `{} as WorldEntityTranslations` casts.
- `src/ui/talent_i18n.ts` (~187 KB) - talent name overrides + description rules.
- `src/ui/entity_i18n.ts` (~297 lines) - runtime entity resolver (`tEntity`); not a key source.
- `src/ui/sim_i18n.ts` (~1,516 lines) - `enTable` + `BASE_DICT` + `PET_DICT` -> `DICT`; EXACT map (auto-built) + ~28 regex RULES; `localizeSimText()`/`tSim()`.
- `src/ui/server_i18n.ts` (~129 lines) - inlined `DICT` + EXACT + ~37 regex RULES; `localizeServerText()`/`tServer()`.
- `src/ui/hud.ts` - `localizeErrorText` (~L2677), `localizeSystemText` (~L2783), `localizeLootText` (~L2867): hud-local EXACT maps + regex chains that run BEFORE delegating to `localizeSimText`/`localizeServerText`. The matcher-coverage surface includes these.
- `src/admin/i18n.ts` (~78 lines, ~108 KB DICT) - flat `Record<locale, Record<key,string>>`, 181 keys × 14 locales, already dense+flat; `classLabel()`. Separate `admin.html` bundle.
- `index.html` - 185 `data-i18n*` attributes, 14 hreflang links, OG/Twitter/JSON-LD meta, `data-i18n-content`.
- `admin.html` - static `<title>`, meta; admin reads locale from `?lang=`/localStorage at runtime.
- `tests/localization_fixes.test.ts` (~669 lines) - B1, L3/L4, H1/H1b/H2, M1/M1b/M1c, H3/H3b, H4b, S1/S2, R1, A1, **S3** (the drift guard that scrapes `sim.ts`/`hud.ts` source, `de_DE`-only today). `COPIED_ALLOW` (~43) and `ALLOW_V07_SLASH` (~105) literal Sets live here.
- `tests/localization_coverage.test.ts` - 14-locale key parity, rendered quest/talent content, accents, CJK-no-Latin, hreflang.
- `tests/server_i18n.test.ts` - server DICT parity + copied-English.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - single `build` job on PR + push to `main`/`dev-*`/`release/**`. `npm test` runs the full localization suite on every push.
- `scripts/build_media_manifest.mjs` - the zero-dep generated-artifact pattern to copy.
- `scripts/localization_e2e.mjs` - 14-locale E2E (homepage/mobile/in-game/a11y).

### New (created by this packet - see per-phase files for exactly when)
- `src/ui/i18n.en.ts` - authoritative nested `en` + `Leaves`/`TranslationKey`/`DeepPartial` machinery. (Phase 1)
- `src/ui/i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` - created NESTED `: typeof en` in Phase 1 (the 13 non-English locale objects, behavior-preserving). Phase 3 converts them to flat `Partial<Record<TranslationKey,string>>` sparse overlays; the only files a translator edits.
- `src/ui/i18n.resolved.generated.ts` - generated dense `: typeof en` table; client + admin import this. (Phase 2)
- `src/ui/i18n.status.json` - generated registry: `translated`/`pending`/`blocked` + `srcHash` + `by`. (Phase 5)
- `src/ui/i18n.resolved.sha256` - committed byte-equivalence baseline. (Phase 1)
- `scripts/i18n_build.mjs` - overlays + emits the resolved artifact. (Phase 2)
- `scripts/i18n_resolved_hash.mjs` - deterministic SHA-256 of the resolved table. (Phase 1)
- `scripts/i18n_scan.mjs` - no-LLM/no-network scanner that rebuilds the registry. (Phase 5)
- `scripts/i18n_fill_worklist.mjs` - emits the per-language `pending` delta for the release fill. (Phase 7)
- `tests/i18n_resolved_equivalence.test.ts` - byte-equivalence + reproducibility test. (Phase 1/2)

## New package.json scripts (added across phases)
- `i18n:build` -> `node scripts/i18n_build.mjs` (Phase 2; folded into `npm run build` + `pretest`)
- `i18n:hash` -> `node scripts/i18n_resolved_hash.mjs` (Phase 1)
- `i18n:scan` -> `node scripts/i18n_scan.mjs` (Phase 5; folded into `pretest`)
- `i18n:worklist` -> `node scripts/i18n_fill_worklist.mjs` (Phase 7)

## Per-phase additions log (fill in as phases complete)
| Phase | New files | New scripts | New tests | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `src/ui/i18n.en.ts`; `src/ui/i18n.locales/{es,es_ES,fr_FR,fr_CA,en_CA,it_IT,de_DE,zh_CN,zh_TW,ko_KR,ja_JP,pt_BR,ru_RU}.ts`; `src/ui/i18n.resolved.sha256` | `scripts/i18n_resolved_hash.mjs` (`i18n:hash`) | `tests/i18n_resolved_equivalence.test.ts` | Monolith split into en base + 13 nested `: typeof en` locale files + thin runtime; all public exports preserved; resolved table byte-identical. Locale files are created NESTED here (Phase 3 flattens them). `en`/locales are assembled by spreading shared content layers (`shellStrings`..`mergeExtra`, now exported from `i18n.en`) + `worldNames` (from `world_entity_i18n`) + a `gameStrings` variant + inline literals; the data is NOT one literal per locale. |
| 2 | `src/ui/i18n.resolved.generated.ts` (generated dense 14-locale table, committed + reproducibility-checked) | `scripts/i18n_build.mjs` (`i18n:build`; wired into `npm run build` before vite + `pretest`) | reproducibility check folded into `tests/i18n_resolved_equivalence.test.ts` (tracked-file + `git diff --exit-code` after regen) | Generated nested table, each locale `: EnTranslations` (= `typeof en`), do-not-edit banner; overlays each locale onto a deep copy of `en` and fills missing leaves from English. Runtime `translations` + the four read-paths (`t`/`translationValue`/`hasTranslation`/`tOptional`) repointed at it - the direct-read gotcha below is now CLOSED. `EnTranslations` added to `i18n.en`. Byte-identical to Phase 1 (SHA `d9db528..`). Generator imports the Phase 1 SOURCE modules (`i18n.en` + `i18n.locales/*`), never `i18n.ts` or the generated file, so no circular import. |
| 3 | (no new src files; the 13 `src/ui/i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` were converted in place from nested `: typeof en` to flat `Record<string, string>`) | `scripts/i18n_flatten.mjs` (shared flatten/unflatten contract, used by the build); `scripts/i18n_flatten_locales.mjs` (one-time migration, not wired into anything) | `tests/i18n_flat_overlay_dense.test.ts` (TEMPORARY: exact key-set vs `flatten(en)` + non-empty strings per overlay; delete in Phase 6); `tests/i18n_overlay_key_membership.test.ts` (Phase 3 QA, PERMANENT: every overlay key is a member of `Leaves(en)` + positive teeth that a typo'd/invented/misspelled dotted key is rejected; subset guard survives the Phase 6 sparse relax) | Main-table locales are now STANDALONE flat dotted-key overlays (full-inline, no imports), keyed in `en`'s leaf order, 1925 dense keys each. Build unflattens each overlay onto a deep copy of nested `en` -> byte-identical artifact (SHA `d9db528..`, blob `90b4326..`, both unchanged). `en`/`i18n.en.ts` and runtime `i18n.ts` UNTOUCHED. **ISLANDS NOT FLATTENED (deferred to Phase 4):** `world_entity_i18n.ts` non-English data is now superseded by the inlined overlays + has zero runtime path-indexers (its `.en` slice still feeds nested `en`); `talent_i18n.ts` is a separate non-table channel with FUNCTION-valued `localeText` leaves that cannot be a flat string map. Overlay type is `Record<string, string>` not `Record<TranslationKey,string>` (Leaves depth 5 < deepest real leaf depth 6). `flatten`/`unflatten` throw on dotted segments / prefix collisions. |
| 4 | (none; `src/ui/world_entity_i18n.ts` reduced to English-only - dead non-English datasets + `makeLocaleWorldEntities` deleted) | `scripts/i18n_build.mjs` gained a data-driven `DIALECT_BASE` map (es_ES->es, fr_CA->fr_FR, en_CA->en) + base-then-dialect merge | `tests/i18n_flat_overlay_dense.test.ts` made dialect-aware (10 dense bases key-exact vs `en`; 3 dialect overlays subset + non-empty + every key diverges from base + strictly sparser) | Dialect dedup: es_ES/fr_CA/en_CA overlays are now divergence-only (72/37/3 keys); build resolves a dialect as nested `en` -> base overlay -> dialect overlay, omitted keys falling through to base then English. Both `{} as` compiler bypasses gone: `world_entity_i18n` casts removed by deleting the dead non-English data (English-only now; only `.en` was ever consumed), `talent_i18n` `localeText` casts replaced by explicit aliases over a `satisfies`-typed base record. Resolved table byte-identical (SHA `d9db528..`, generated blob unchanged). `en` still NESTED; overlays still typed `Record<string,string>`. talent `titleOverrides` es_ES/fr_CA left as full blocks (live, not byte-gated, no cast; out of scope). |

## Glossary of locked terms (for the release fill; never auto-translate)
Project name "World of ClaudeCraft"; the 9 class names; ability names; zone/dungeon proper nouns. The release fill ships this glossary with every batch so per-locale terminology does not drift. (Authored in Phase 7.)

## Known gotchas / OPEN items
- CLOSED (Phase 2): `tOptional`, `hasTranslation`, and internal `translationValue` read the table directly - under sparse overlays a key can be genuinely absent at runtime. They are now pointed at the dense resolved artifact (the runtime `translations` is imported from `src/ui/i18n.resolved.generated.ts`), so all four read-paths read the dense table. Phase 3 onward must keep it that way - never repoint a read-path back at the raw `i18n.locales/*` overlays.
- BUNDLE (Phase 2, watch in later phases): the dense generated table fully inlines all 14 locales, so it loses the cross-locale reference-sharing the spread-assembled table had. Main client bundle gzip grew 966.77 -> 1120.64 KB (+15.9%). A naive repoint is far worse (+479.8 KB gzip): the `gameStrings` re-export from `i18n.en` drags the entire ~1 MB `i18n.en` base into the client bundle alongside the inlined table. Phase 2 sources `gameStrings` from the generated `en.game` instead, recovering ~326 KB gzip. The remaining ~154 KB is partly `world_entity_i18n` entity data being inlined in the table AND still bundled for the `hud`/`entity_i18n` runtime resolver - a candidate dedup if a later phase routes entity resolution through the table.
- The S3 guard is source-text scraping (regex over `sim.ts`/`hud.ts`); splitting it into `s3_registered`/`s3_localized` (Phase 6) preserves the scraping approach and its brittleness. Treat matcher coverage (including hud-local maps) as ongoing maintenance, not solved.
- RESOLVED (Phase 4): the main table and `world_entity_i18n` no longer have different dialect starting points. The main-table dialects are divergence-only overlays over a declared base; `world_entity_i18n` is English-only (its non-English data, including the es_ES/fr_CA aliases, was deleted). Dialect inheritance for BOTH the resolved table and (formerly) world_entity now flows through one mechanism: the build resolver's `DIALECT_BASE` merge.
- RESOLVED (Phase 4): the `{} as WorldEntityTranslations` cast (and the equivalent `{} as TalentLocaleText` in `talent_i18n.ts`) are gone. `world_entity_i18n.ts` is English-only (dead non-English data deleted), so there is no dialect cast there to bypass `: typeof en`; `talent_i18n.ts` `localeText` now assembles es_ES/fr_CA as explicit aliases over a `satisfies`-typed base record (no cast, no reassignment).
- RESOLVED (Phase 4) - PHASE 3 HANDOFF TO PHASE 4 (islands): `world_entity_i18n.ts` was reduced to English-only (the dead non-English slices + `makeLocaleWorldEntities` deleted; only `.en` was ever consumed, by `i18n.en.ts`). Maintainer chose DELETE over re-establishing it as the single entity source (which would have reversed Phase 3's full-inline). `talent_i18n.ts` stayed a separate function-valued channel read nested at runtime by `tTalent`; only its dialect casts were removed - its `titleOverrides` es_ES/fr_CA full blocks were left as-is (live, not byte-gated, no cast; deduping them was out of scope for this phase).
- Admin DICT is already flat + dense; it is the closest to the target shape. Phase 8 brings it under the registry + sparse model without regressing its 14-locale completeness.
- One hardcoded `window.alert(...)` at ~`src/admin/main.ts:401` is missing a translation (flagged during exploration). Fix it in Phase 8.
- A cooldown timer at ~`src/ui/hud.ts:1674` uses `Math.ceil(cd).toString()` instead of `formatNumber` (number-localization bypass). Note for Phase 6/8 polish; not load-bearing.
- `scripts/i18n_flatten_locales.mjs` is a ONE-SHOT migration: it already ran and now THROWS on re-run (the locale files are flat, and `flatten` rejects their dotted top-level keys by the fail-loud contract). Do NOT re-run it to onboard a new locale in a later phase - author the new overlay flat directly (copy an existing `src/ui/i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` shape) or unflatten/flatten by hand. Comments corrected in Phase 3 QA (commit `c5f6738`).
- BYTE FIGURES, three of them, do not conflate: the byte-equivalence GATE is the canonical key-sorted serialization SHA `d9db528..` / 1,584,856 bytes (`i18n_resolved_hash.mjs`). The generated FILE `src/ui/i18n.resolved.generated.ts` is 2,003,477 bytes on disk (formatted `.ts`): its sha256 is `554a0e6c..` and its git blob is `90b4326..`. All three are stable and independently meaningful; only `d9db528..` is the gate.
